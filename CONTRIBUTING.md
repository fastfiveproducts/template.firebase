## File Headers and Versioning

All GQL source files should include a standard file header that provides authorship, licensing, and version context.

### General Rules

- **NEW files**: Use the current year.
- **CHANGED files**: Append new years (e.g., `2025, 2026`) to reflect modification history.
- **Template version**: Update the version number for any file added to or modified in the TEMPLATE project
